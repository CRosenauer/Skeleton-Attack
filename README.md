# Skeleton Attack
 A simple arcade-style game made in Godot with the purpose
 of learning game development and game development tools.

# Overview
 Skeleton attack is a simple arcade-style game where you
 move around attacking skeletons before the timer runs out.
 W/A/S/D to move your character, K to start the game and attack.
 
 Skeleton Attack was built in Godot as part of an effort to dip
 my toes in the world of game development after my own engine development
 efforts went south.
